# Music Recommendation System

This is a python project.

This is a fun project in which I will be developing a recommendation system which recommends top 5 songs based on the user's liked playlist.

## Data
- The data used in this project is taken from Million Playist Dataset (MPD) from Spotify.
- Initially my aim is to build a model using a subset of 1000 playlists from MPD.
- This dataset is available at [https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge)


## API
To run this project locally, run these following commands:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
